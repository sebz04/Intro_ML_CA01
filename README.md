# Intro_ML_CA01
Computer Assignment 01 EDA

Overview

This repository contains my submission for CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal of this assignment is to analyze and prepare a housing price dataset for future machine learning modeling by thoroughly understanding its structure, quality, and relationships among variables.

The focus of this assignment is data understanding, data quality assessment, preprocessing, and collinearity analysis. Model building is intentionally not included.

Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the House Price Training Dataset, which contains various property features that may be predictive of residential sale prices.

Source: Provided by the course GitHub repository

File used: house-price-train.csv

Target variable: SalePrice

The dataset was accessed directly via a raw GitHub URL within the notebook.

Assignment Structure

The analysis is organized into the following sections within the Jupyter Notebook:

1. Data Understanding

Dataset structure and summary statistics

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations

Initial observations and patterns

Data Quality Report identifying potential issues

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Identifying and assessing outliers

Detecting invalid or suspicious values

Reviewing and correcting data type inconsistencies

All cleaning decisions are explained and justified within the notebook.

3. Collinearity & Feature Selection

Correlation analysis using a heatmap

Identification of highly correlated features

Discussion of potential feature redundancy

(Class imbalance and model training are not included, per assignment instructions.)

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab
